Hello, i'm Xushi. <br>
I'm just some random person here. <br>
Very beginner and average programmer, just joined :D <br>
still in school, learning to become a game designer(?). <br>
Currently learning C#, HTML and CSS. <br> <br>
Nothing much to say about me, i guess? <br> <br>
I like reading WebNovels <br>

Animes, Manhwa, Manga (Shohen fan) and yadda yadda, the usual stuff, like a weeb <br>
Tried to write something once, but failed and didn't get more inspirations <br>
i guess you call that volatile inspiration? <i>Shrugs</i> not that it matters <br>
