Hello, i'm Xushi.  
I'm just some random person here.  
Very beginner and average programmer, just joined :D  
still in school, learning to become a game designer(?).  
Currently learning C#, HTML and CSS.    
Nothing much to say about me, i guess?    
I like reading WebNovels

Animes, Manhwa, Manga (Shohen fan) and yadda yadda, the usual stuff, like a weeb  
Tried to write something once, but failed and didn't get more inspirations  
i guess you call that volatile inspiration? <i>Shrugs</i> not that it matters
